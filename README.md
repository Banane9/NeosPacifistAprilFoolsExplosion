Pacifist April Fools Explosion
==============================

A [NeosModLoader](https://github.com/zkxs/NeosModLoader) mod for [Neos VR](https://neos.com/) that can individually disable the bloating and explosion sound effects, as well as the flame particles from the `ViolentAprilFoolsExplosion` component. Which parts get disabled can be changed in the settings.

## Installation
1. Install [NeosModLoader](https://github.com/zkxs/NeosModLoader).
2. Place [LocalLogixRegisters.dll](https://github.com/Banane9/NeosPacifistAprilFoolsExplosion/releases/latest/download/PacifistAprilFoolsExplosion.dll) into your `nml_mods` folder. This folder should be at `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\NeosVR\nml_mods` for a default install. You can create it if it's missing, or if you launch the game once with NeosModLoader installed it will create the folder for you.
4. Start the game. If you want to verify that the mod is working you can check your Neos logs.
